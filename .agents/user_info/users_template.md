# User Info (Template)

This document captures who uses/maintains a repo and what constraints/preferences should guide changes. It exists to reduce
guessing by future contributors and coding agents.

How to use:
- Copy this file to `.agents/user_info/users.md` and fill in real values for this repo.
- Keep it concrete and link to existing docs (README/CONTRIBUTING/AGENTS/etc.) instead of duplicating them.

## Primary Maintainer

- Name/handle:
- Role:
- Working environment (OS/shell/editor):
- Priorities (what "good" looks like):
- Hard constraints (non-negotiable):
- "Do not do" list:
- Review/acceptance expectations:

## Contributors (optional)

- Who contributes and how (PRs only? direct pushes?):
- Expectations for code style and docs:

## Consumers / Intended Audience

Describe the people who use this repo's output (if any), not just the repo itself.

- Persona 1:
  - Goal:
  - Assumed tooling:
  - Common pitfalls / sharp edges:
- Persona 2:
  - Goal:
  - Assumed tooling:

## Notes For Agents

- Where the "product" lives (key directories):
- Commands to use for development in this repo:
- Testing constraints (offline? network allowed? external binaries?):
- Where plans/specs/artifacts must live:
- CI expectations (supported OS/Python versions, etc.):
