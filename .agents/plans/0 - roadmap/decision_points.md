# Pending Decision Points


1) Do we want to treat this as a "template repo" or a CLI?

- Template Repo: Users generate a new repo from this template, which includes scaffolding too, the monorepo publisher tool and related workflows.
- CLI Tool: Users install this as a CLI tool globally or in their environment and all of the scaffolding and workflows are accessed from there.

*Status*: Undecided. Tentatively implementing as a template repo.
